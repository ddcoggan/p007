Data and code for Human Brain Mapping paper, 2019

Experiment 1

MVPA.R analyses neural representational similarity matrices stored in matrices.csv. These 20 x 20 matrices (all pairwise comparisons between 10 untextured and 10 textured clusters) are flattened and stored in rows, with subject and ROI identifiers placed at the start of each row.

Experiment 2

Same as experiment 1 but files are named MVPA2.R and matrices2.csv.

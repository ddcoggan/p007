Data and code for Coggan, D. D., Giannakopoulou, A., Ali, S., Goz, B., Watson, D. M., Hartley, T., … Andrews, T. J. (2019). A data‐driven approach to stimulus selection reveals an image‐based representation of objects in high‐level visual areas. Human Brain Mapping, (June), hbm.24732. https://doi.org/10.1002/hbm.24732

Experiment 1

MVPA.R analyses neural representational similarity matrices stored in matrices.csv. These 20 x 20 matrices (all pairwise comparisons between 10 untextured and 10 textured clusters) are flattened and stored in rows, with subject and ROI identifiers placed at the start of each row.

Experiment 2

Same as experiment 1 but files are named MVPA2.R and matrices2.csv.
